## Form
Django provides a range of tools and libraries to help you build forms to accept input from site visitors, and then process and respond to the input.
### HTML forms
In HTML, a form is a collection of elements inside `<form>...</form>` that allow a visitor to do things like enter text, select options, manipulate objects or controls, and so on, and then send that information back to the server.

Handling forms is a complex business. Consider below Registration example, where numerous items of data of several different types may need to be prepared for display in a form, rendered as HTML, edited using a convenient interface, returned to the server, validated and cleaned up, and then saved or passed on for further processing.

``` html
    <form class="form" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="firstName">First Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" placeholder="Enter your First Name">
        <br>
        <label for="lastName">Last Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="lastName" name="lastName" placeholder="Enter your First Name">
        <br>
        <label for="emailId">Email Id</label>
        <input type="text" id="emailId" name="emailId" placeholder="Email">
        <br>
        <label for="password">Password</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password" placeholder="password">
        <br>
        <label for="phoneNo">Phone Number</label>
        <input type="text" id="phoneNo" name="phoneNo" placeholder="Phone Number">
        <br>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit"> login </button>
    </div>
</form>
 
```
Django’s form functionality can simplify and automate vast portions of this work, and can also do it more securely than most programmers would be able to do in code they wrote themselves.

> **_NOTE:_** In the context of a Web application, ‘form’ might refer to that HTML `<form>`, or to the Django Form that produces it, or to the structured data returned when it is submitted, or to the end-to-end working collection of these parts.

### The Django Form class
A Form class describes a form and determines how it works and appears.In a similar way that a model class’s fields map to database fields, a form class’s fields map to HTML form `<input>` elements.

## Building a form in Django
By Consider the above Registraion example, which we could use to implement “Registraion” functionality on our website: 
First we need to create **froms.py** file in our app location
